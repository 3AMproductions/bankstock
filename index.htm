	<h2>Why purchase Bank Shares?</h2>
	<p>BankShares.com is an affiliate of BancShareholders of America, an Investment Advisor. BancShareholders of America's focuses upon investments in micro to mid-cap community bank stock. It is our belief that a portfolio of these types of equities, provided they fit our strict criteria, can provide a favorable degree of safety while providing returns higher than the major indices.</p>
  <p>Our long history of personal relationships with many bankers, located primarily in the Midwest, is extremely advantageous with our narrow focus. Brad Smith, president of BancShareholders of America for the past 30 years, and his strong relationships with community bankers across the U.S. allows him to obtain stock in banks that typically did not have high volumes of trade. He has also been a leader in providing various consulting services such as <a href="Stock_Navigation.htm">Stock Navigation</a> and <a href="investment_banking.htm">Investment Banking</a> to these institutions.</p>
  <p>BancShareholders of America's focus and expertise enables us to partner with several large money managers to invest a percentage of assets into community bank stocks. This demand caused us to establish Unit Investment Trusts that we make available to investment advisors, trust departments and CPAs to use to take advantage of this opportunity.</p>
  <p>If you would like to hear more about our services please <a href="contact.htm">fill out this simple form</a>. We will register you to receive a complimentary copy of our newsletter World of Bankstock.</p>
